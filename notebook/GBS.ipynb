    "## Theory:\n",

    "### Generalized Black Scholes\n",
    "Black Scholes genre option models widely used to value European options. The original “Black Scholes” model was published in 1973 for non-dividend paying stocks. This created a revolution in quantitative finance and opened up option trading to the general population. Since that time, a wide variety of extensions to the original Black Scholes model have been created. Collectively, these are referred to as \"Black Scholes genre” option models. Modifications of the formula are used to price other financial instruments like dividend paying stocks, commodity futures, and FX forwards. Mathematically, these formulas are nearly identical. The primary difference between these models is whether the asset has a carrying cost (if the asset has a cost or benefit associated with holding it) and how the asset gets present valued. To illustrate this relationship, a “generalized” form of the Black Scholes equation is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black Scholes model is based on number of assumptions about how financial markets operate. Black Scholes style models assume:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\t**Arbitrage Free Markets**. Black Scholes formulas assume that traders try to maximize their personal profits and don’t allow arbitrage opportunities (riskless opportunities to make a profit) to persist. \n",
    "2.\t**Frictionless, Continuous Markets**. This assumption of frictionless markets assumes that it is possible to buy and sell any amount of the underlying at any time without transaction costs.\n",
    "3.\t**Risk Free Rates**. It is possible to borrow and lend money at a risk-free interest rate\n",
    "4.\t**Log-normally Distributed Price Movements**. Prices are log-normally distributed and described by Geometric Brownian Motion\n",
    "5.\t**Constant Volatility**. The Black Scholes genre options formulas assume that volatility is constant across the life of the option contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, these assumptions are not particularly limiting. The primary limitation imposed by these models is that it is possible to (reasonably) describe the dispersion of prices at some point in the future in a mathematical equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the traditional Black Scholes model intended to price stock options, the underlying assumption is that the stock is traded at its present value and that prices will follow a random walk diffusion style process over time. Prices are assumed to start at the spot price and, on the average, to drift upwards over time at the risk free rate. The “Merton” formula modifies the basic Black Scholes equation by introducing an additional term to incorporate dividends or holding costs. The Black 76 formula modifies the assumption so that the underlying starts at some forward price rather than a spot price. A fourth variation, the Garman Kohlhagen model, is used to value foreign exchange (FX) options. In the GK model, each currency in the currency pair is discounted based on its own interest rate.\n",
    " \n",
    "1.\t**Black Scholes (Stocks)**. In the traditional Black Scholes model, the option is based on common stock - an instrument that is traded at its present value. The stock price does not get present valued – it starts at its present value (a ‘spot price’) and drifts upwards over time at the risk free rate. \n",
    "2.\t**Merton (Stocks with continuous dividend yield)**. The Merton model is a variation of the Black Scholes model for assets that pay dividends to shareholders. Dividends reduce the value of the option because the option owner does not own the right to dividends until the option is exercised. \n",
    "3.\t**Black 76 (Commodity Futures)**. The Black 76 model is for an option where the underlying commodity is traded based on a future price rather than a spot price. Instead of dealing with a spot price that drifts upwards at the risk free rate, this model deals with a forward price that needs to be present valued. \n",
    "4.\t**Garman-Kohlhagen (FX Futures)**. The Garman Kohlhagen model is used to value foreign exchange (FX) options. In the GK model, each currency in the currency pair is discounted based on its own interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important concept of Black Scholes models is that the actual way that the underlying asset drifts over time isn't important to the valuation. Since European options can only be exercised when the contract expires, it is only the distribution of possible prices on that date that matters - the path that the underlying took to that point doesn't affect the value of the option. This is why the primary limitation of the model is being able to describe the dispersion of prices at some point in the future, not that the dispersion process is simplistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generalized Black-Scholes formula can found below (see *Figure 1 – Generalized Black Scholes Formula*). While these formulas may look complicated at first glance, most of the terms can be found as part of an options contract or are prices readily available in the market.  The only term that is difficult to calculate is the implied volatility (σ). Implied volatility is typically calculated using prices of other options that have recently been traded.\n",

    "### Asian Volatility Adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "An Asian option is an option whose payoff is calculated using the average price of the underlying over some period of time rather than the price on the expiration date. As a result, Asian options are also called average price options. The reason that traders use Asian options is that averaging a settlement price over a period of time reduces the affect of manipulation or unusual price movements on the expiration date on the value of the option. As a result, Asian options are often found on strategically important commodities, like crude oil or in markets with intermittent trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average of a set of random numbers (prices in this case) will have a lower dispersion (a lower volatility) than the dispersion of prices observed on any single day. As a result, the implied volatility used to price Asian options will usually be slightly lower than the implied volatility on a comparable European option. From a mathematical perspective, valuing an Asian option is slightly complicated since the average of a set of lognormal distributions is not itself lognormally distributed. However, a reasonably good approximation of the correct answer is not too difficult to obtain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Asian options on futures, it is possible to use a modified Black-76 formula that replaces the implied volatility term with an adjusted implied volatility of the average price.  As long as the first day of the averaging period is in the future, the following formula can be used to value Asian options (see *Figure 3 – Asian Option Formula*).\n",

    "### Spread Option (Kirk's Approximation) Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Spread options are based on the spread between two commodity prices. They are commonly used to model physical investments as \"real options\" or to mark-to-market contracts that hedge physical assets. For example, a natural gas fueled electrical generation unit can be used to convert fuel (natural gas) into electricity. Whenever this conversion is profitable, it would be rational to operate the unit. This type of conversion is readily modeled by a spread option. When the spread of (electricity prices - fuel costs) is greater than the conversion cost, then the unit would operate. In this example, the conversion cost, which might be called the *Variable Operations and Maintenance* or VOM for a generation unit, would represent the strike price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytic formulas similar to the Black Scholes equation are commonly used to value commodity spread options. One such formula is called *Kirk’s approximation*. While an exact closed form solution does not exist to value spread options, approximate solutions can give reasonably accurate results.  Kirk’s approximation uses a Black Scholes style framework to analyze the joint distribution that results from the ratio of two log-normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Black Scholes equation, the distribution of price returns is assumed to be normally distributed on the expiration date. Kirk’s approximation builds on the Black Scholes framework by taking advantage of the fact that the ratio of two log-normal distributions is approximately normally distributed.  By modeling a ratio of two prices rather than the spread between the prices, Kirk’s approximation can use the same formulas designed for options based on a single underlying. In other words, Kirk’s approximation uses an algebraic transformation to fit the spread option into the Black Scholes framework.\n",

The price of the first asset, electricity, might be quoted in US dollars per megawatt-hour or USD/MWH. However, the price of the second asset might be quoted in USD/MMBTU. To use the approximation, it is necessary to convert the price of the second asset into the units of the first asset (See *Example 1 - a Heat Rate Option*).

    "### American Options\n",
    "American options differ from European options because they can be exercised at any time. If there is a possibility that it will be more profitable to exercise the option than sell it, an American option will have more value than a corresponding European option. Early exercise typically occurs only when an option is *in the money*. If an option is out of the money, there is usually no reason to exercise early - it would be better to sell the option (in the case of a put option, to sell the option and the underlying asset).\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision of whether to exercise early is primarily a question of interest rates and carrying costs. Carrying costs, or *cost of carry*, is a term that means an intermediate cash flows that is the result of holding an asset. For example, dividends on stocks are a postive cost of carry (owning the asset gives the owner a cash flow). A commodity might have a negative cost of carry. For example, a commodity that requires its owner to pay for storage would cause the owner of the physical commodity to pay cash to hold the asset. (**Note:** Commodity options are typically written on forwards or futures which have zero cost of carry instead of the actual underlying commodity). Cost of carry is cash flow that affects the owner of the underlying commodity and not the owner of the option. For example, when a stock pays a dividend, the owner of a call option does not receive the dividend - just the owner of the stock. For the perspective for the owner of a call option on a stock, the cost of carry will be the interest received from holding cash (r) less any dividends paid to owners of the stock (q).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since an option has some value (the *extrinsic value*) that would be given up by exercising the option, exercising an option prior to maturity is a trade off between the option's extrinsic value (the remaining optionality) and the relative benefit of holding cash (time value of money) versus the benefit of holding the asset (carrying costs). \n",
    "\n",
    "The early exercise feature of **American equity put options** may have value when:\n",
    "* The cost of carry on the asset is low - preferably zero or negative. \n",
    "* Interest rates are high  \n",
    "* The option is in the money\n",
    "\n",
    "The early exercise feature of **American equity call options** may have value when:\n",
    "* The cost of carry on the asset is positive\n",
    "* Interest rates are low or negative\n",
    "* The option is in the money \n",
    "\n",
    "With commodities, things are a slightly different. There is typically no cost of carry since the underlying is a forward or a futures contract. It does not cost any money to enter an at-the-money commodity forward, swap, or futures contract. Also, these contracts don't have any intermediate cash flows. As a result, the primary benefit of early exercise is to get cash immediately (exercising an in-the-money option) rather than cash in the future. In high interest rate environements, the money recieved immediately from immediate execution may exceed the extrinsic value of the contract. This is due to strike price not being present valued in immediate execution (it is specified in the contract and a fixed number) but the payoff of a European option is discounted (forward price - strike price). \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall result is that early exercise is fairly uncommon for most commodity options. Typically, it only occurs when interest rates are high. Generally, interest rates have to be higher than 15%-20% for American commodity options to differ substantially in value from European options with the same terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The early exercise feature of **American commodity options** has value when:\n",
    "* Interest rates are high\n",
    "* Volatility is low (this makes selling the option less of a good option)\n",
    "* The option is in the money \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no exact closed-form solution for American options. However, there are many approximations that are reasonably close to prices produced by open-form solutions (like binomial tree models). Two models are shown below, both created by Bjerksund and Stensland. The first was produced in 1993 and the second in 2002. The second model is a refinement of the first model, adding more complexity, in exchange for better accuracy. "
